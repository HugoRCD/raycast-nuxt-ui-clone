> A Raycast command palette clone to showcase Nuxt UI component customization capabilities.

## What is this?

This project recreates Raycast's command palette interface using **only Nuxt UI components**. The goal was to see how far we could push component customization and prove that complex UIs can be built entirely with Nuxt UI.

**What's included:**
- Pixel-perfect Raycast interface (Command Palette, Modal, Dropdown Menu)
- Modular extension system (GitHub, VSCode, Spotify, Color Picker, Kill Process)
- Dynamic actions with right-click support and keyboard shortcuts
- Random favorites and suggestions

**What's missing:**
- Real functionality (it's just UI mockups)
- Actual API integrations

## Tech Stack

- Nuxt 3 + TypeScript
- Nuxt UI v3 components
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Modular architecture with composables

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HugoRCD/raycast-nuxt-ui-clone.git
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing

Want to make this actually functional? Cool ideas:

- Implement real GitHub/Spotify API integrations
- Add new extensions (Notion, Slack, etc.)
- Create a plugin system
- Fork it and build your own command palette

Just fork, create a branch, and submit a PR.
